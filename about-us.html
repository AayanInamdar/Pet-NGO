        <h1>Where Every Pet Finds a Loving Home</h1>
        <p>About Us Pet In started as a small venture on October 5, 2021, when three friends came together with a shared vision of creating a better world for animals. What began as a pet shop blossomed into a full-fledged NGO in 2024, based in Pune. We
            are driven by compassion and rely entirely on donations to make a difference. Our work includes rescuing animals, administering rabies and other essential vaccinations, providing medicines for various diseases, and equipping pets with reflective
            collars to prevent accidents.</p>
        <p>Currently, we extend our efforts to Pune, Mumbai, and Punjab, and have plans to expand our surveys and services to other cities such as Hyderabad, Karnataka, and Chhattisgarh. Along the way, we‚Äôve also connected countless pets and street animals
            with loving families, ensuring they receive the care and attention they deserve. At Pet In, every small step is a leap toward creating a world where animals are cherished, nurtured, and given a second chance at life.</p>
